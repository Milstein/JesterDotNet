*How are we going to ensure that prefs are saved?  Should it implement IDisposable and save on dispose?
*Try displaying the types by namespace in the assembly graph viewer (CeCil looks like it may have this ability)
*Need to implment the progress bar
*Need to figure out how to associate the failing test results with the conditional definitions
*Review the remaining TODOs

*Try and figure out how to read PDBs so that we can display the source code in the app
*Refactor MbUnit related code into a separate assembly to reinforce the plugin architecture
*There shouldn't be an MbUnit specific reference inside of the preferences file, it should
	only refer to the type of testing framework used
