*Need to figure out how to associate the failing test results with the conditional definitions
*Try displaying the types by namespace in the assembly graph viewer (CeCil looks like it may have this ability)
*Need to be able to cancel the mutation
*Review the remaining TODOs
*How are we going to ensure that prefs are saved?  Should it implement IDisposable and save on dispose?
*need to fix the issue where the .JST file has to be in the same directory as the assemblies 
	(set the current working directory to the directory of the test assembly or figure out how to get it to use the GAC)

*Try and figure out how to read PDBs so that we can display the source code in the app
*Refactor MbUnit related code into a separate assembly to reinforce the plugin architecture
*There shouldn't be an MbUnit specific reference inside of the preferences file, it should
	only refer to the type of testing framework used
